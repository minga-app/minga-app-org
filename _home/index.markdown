  title: Situation in Chile
- content: Only during the first months and only in Chile, Covid-19 has already left
    an estimated 2.5 million people unemployed.
- content: That means a  critical situation for roughly <strong>2.5 million families</strong>.
- include: charts/bar.html
  content: Even Chile's so-called middle-class, which was doing well "on paper" but
    is highly indebted, is in danger of losing everything they've ever had to the
    creditors.
- content: The latest amendments to the Chilean anti-foodwaste legislation, approved
    by the Senate at the beginning of August and now waiting to pass in Congress,
    is still in danger of being rejected, and supermarkets keep destroying tons of
    food shortly before its expiry date.

  small_content: 'Points can create advantage: instead of working for the Chilean
    average wage of 3 EUR/hour to then take the $$ to the supermarket and come home
    with 2 kilos of bread, in our model you would get whatever''s there on that day,
    or and if you save up your points, even that much-needed winter jacket or a phone
    card.'
